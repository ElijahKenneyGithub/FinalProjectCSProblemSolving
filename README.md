# Danny's Branch of the CS Problem Solving Final Project
This branch contains parts of the final project that Daniel Drysdale is working on

Hello and welcome to the contents of our audio analysis software.
Contained within this repository are the files necessary to insert wav and mp3 files to compute visual data that informs the user of the time between reverberations. The exact order of the procedures is that this program will clean the audio file to remove background elements and interference, analyyze the data, create a spectogram using multiple python extentions. Finally, through a using a series of filtration and mathematics, the system will compute and display within the console the decible peaks and intervals between reverberations as a numeric value. This project is ran using pycharm as a compiler, however, any compiler that can interperpt python code should suffice. To utilize this program follow the procedures listed below:
